# ⛅ Weather API Wrapper Service

> 💡 **Inspired by the learning path at:** [roadmap.sh/get-started](https://roadmap.sh/get-started)

A robust backend service built with **Python and Flask** that acts as an intermediary (wrapper) to fetch weather data. The project connects to the external OpenWeatherMap API and implements a caching system using **Redis** to optimize performance, reduce latency, and minimize external requests.

This project is part of the backend development challenges from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **External API Integration:** Consumes and filters real-time data from OpenWeatherMap.
*   **Advanced Caching:** Uses Redis to temporarily store responses (TTL) and avoid redundant queries to the external API.
*   **Error Handling:** Manages HTTP status codes to gracefully handle "city not found" or connection errors.
*   **Integrated Frontend:** Clean and intuitive web interface using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Security:** Uses environment variables (`.env`) to protect sensitive credentials and API Keys.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask
*   **Database / Cache:** Redis
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript (Fetch API)
*   **Libraries:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `redis`
